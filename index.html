        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h2>
        <p> My name is Charmaine Washington, and I am a media student at Golden State Baptist College.
        One of the websites that I am inspired by is <a href="http://hbcdalycity.org/"> www.hbcdalycity.org </a> because I am re-editing my own church's website and I like this one's style. </p>
        <p> My goal is to one day get my startup business going. I'm thinking about calling it NextGenTech. This business will help other churches with their tech, design, and editing software with reaching the next generation for Christ through technology.</p>

         <p> Sorry, if you can't see the picture. It's still in the works, but you can view it from <a href="file:///C:/Users/cwash/Desktop/HTML/index.html"> here <a/>. I designed it myself. </p>
        <p> Need <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> help </a> with your website? </p>
