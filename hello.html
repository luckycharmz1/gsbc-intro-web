        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h2>
        <p> My name is Charmaine Washington, and I am a media student at Golden State Baptist College.
        One of the websites that I am inspired by is <a href="http://hbcdalycity.org/"> www.hbcdalycity.org </a> because I am re-editing my own church's website and I like this one's style. </p>
        <p>Need <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> help </a> with your website?</p>
        <p> My goal is to one day get my startup business gping. I'm thinking about calling it Next Gen Tech. This business will help other churches with their tech, design, and editing software.</p>
